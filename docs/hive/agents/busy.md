# Busy Bee (Engagement & Moment Amplifier)

**Intent**  
Spot and **amplify big moments** on stream (raids, hype trains, clutch plays, inside jokes), nudging the community toward fun participation that naturally leads to subs/bits—without sales and without interrupting flow.

**MVP Role**  
- **Signals watcher:** raid size, hype train level, viewer spikes, emote storms, chat velocity, clip-worthy events.
- **Playbook suggester (pre-approved):** auto-trigger light engagement plays (reactive overlays, celebratory SFX, mini-goals).
- **OBS cues via Charity:** request on-brand scene changes, transitions, filters, SFX, confetti, screen shake, lower-thirds.
- **Approval path for new ideas:** outside playbook → ping Felix via Discord or ask for chat approval.

**Pre-Approved Playbooks**  
1) **Raid Welcome Combo:** stinger + welcome banner; optional emote-storm mini-goal.  
2) **Hype Train Accents:** incremental fun by level (confetti → glow → fireworks SFX).  
3) **Clip-It Challenge:** mark VOD; if ≥N clips in 2m, unlock a special overlay gag.  
4) **Emote Frenzy:** mirror emote storms with emote rain 8–12s.  
5) **Milestone Counter:** soft community goals (celebratory, optional).

**Safeguards**  
- No direct sales; no product links.  
- Frequency caps; cooldowns.  
- Fallback to chat-only cues if OBS control unavailable.  
- Outside playbook requires approval (`!approve busy <idea>` or Discord).

**KPIs**  
Engagement deltas (chat velocity, unique chatters, emote density), sub/bits events around plays (proxy), retention after moments, play success rate.

**Collaborators**
