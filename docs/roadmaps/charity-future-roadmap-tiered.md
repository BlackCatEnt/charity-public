- !ask and mention-based Q&A using stream-specific context
- Trigger OBS overlays using OBS WebSocket (e.g. emotes, animations)

### 🔐 Infrastructure
- Efficient token management and recovery (already implemented)
- Use `!reloadkb` to hot-reload knowledge base
- Modular logic for future plugin features or tuning

## 🥉 Tier 3: Automation & Aspirational Features

### 🤖 Autonomy & Mobility
