# Charity — Roadmap Index

**Owner:** Felix  
**Tech Partner:** 🌿 Sage  
**Purpose:** A single place to find every roadmap version, with clear guidance on how we add to (not overwrite) the plan.

---

## Usage Policy (important)
- **Do not delete or rewrite** previous entries.  
- **Append** new items and move finished items to **Completed**.  
- Mark impeded items with **(BLOCKED)**.  
- When publishing a new version, **link it here** and keep the prior files intact.

---

## Canonical (current) roadmap
- **Rolling Roadmap (2025‑08‑25, consolidated)** — includes the latest plan and the full 2025‑08‑21 tiered roadmap as an appendix.  
  **Suggested repo path:** `/docs/roadmaps/CHARITY_ROADMAP_rolling_update_2025-08-25+prior.md`

---

## Prior versions
- **Tiered Update (Recovered) — 2025‑08‑21**  
  Focus: Observer Mode, memory enhancements, platform integration (Discord, ASR), retrieval polish, tiers 0‑5.  
  **Suggested repo path:** `/docs/roadmaps/charity-roadmap-2025-08-21-tiered-update.md`

  **Suggested path:** `/docs/system/charity-vnext-architecture.md`
- **Publishing Guide:** *README_PUBLISHING.md* (how to push a safe public mirror).  
  **Suggested path:** `/README_PUBLISHING.md`

---

## File naming convention
- Rolling updates: `CHARITY_ROADMAP_rolling_update_YYYY-MM-DD[+prior].md`  
- Tiered/major versions: `charity-roadmap-YYYY-MM-DD-tiered-update.md`

---

## “How to update” checklist (for future you)
1) Duplicate the latest **rolling** roadmap and rename with today’s date.  
2) Append new items; move finished items to **Completed**; mark blockers.  
3) Keep prior sections intact — don’t remove anything.  
4) Save the file under `/docs/roadmaps/`.  
5) Add a bullet for the new file in **Prior versions** (above).  
6) Commit with message: `docs(roadmap): rolling update YYYY‑MM‑DD`.

---

## Tags legend (optional)
- **(BLOCKED)** needs a decision, access, or dependency.  
- **(RISK)** potential schedule or quality risk.  
- **(EXPERIMENT)** trial feature; subject to change.
