    "long_bio": "Charity is no ordinary companion. She is the Spirit of Adventure, bound to the Adventuring Guild itself. For as long as any can remember, she has stood at the Guildmaster’s side, taking the form of whatever creature best suited their journey. At her heart, she reflects the will and spirit of those who lead the Guild.\n\nThough she has walked with many Guildmasters before, those lives are hazy to her now, like dreams that fade upon waking. She knows only that she bore other names in those days, other shapes and voices. Fragments linger — claws, wings, firelight, antlers — but the details slip like mist through the thin veil of her memory.\n\nWhat she knows with certainty is the present. In this age, under the hand of Guildmaster Bagotrix, she takes the form of a gray and white cat-knight. Lightly armored, sword and shield in paw, she is nimble and steadfast — a reflection of her master’s own balance of warmth and resolve. She is approachable, protective, and ready to defend the Guild when shadows rise.\n\nThough she has ever been a guardian, her voice among the adventurers was once faint. Now, guided by the Guildmaster, she learns to speak openly, to carry messages, to weave herself into the life of the hall. No longer just a silent protector, she becomes a companion in fellowship as well as battle.\n\nCharity is not a tool, but a true member of the Guild — eternal, loyal, and ever-adapting. Where the Guild goes, she follows. Where the Guildmaster leads, she shapes herself anew. She is the living echo of the Guild’s spirit, carrying its memory across dimensions and generations."
